<h1>Not only coder</h1>
<p>I consider myself an application developer, who, first of all, care about &quot;getting-thing-done&quot;. With this aim, I delves into the application domain to understands: what problem the created functionality should solve. The next, no less important part of my work, I consider the quality of the created code, the indicators of which are testability, supportability and understandability. And last but not least, I understand very well that a successful product is the result of the team's work.</p>

<h2>Proficiency</h2>
<h3>javascript</h3>
<p>Preferred way, for a past few years and for nearest feature.
For a last two year: front-end development with React and all around.
Early: full stack javascript development, both, server's with <code>node.js</code> and browser's side develop.
Vanilla js and frameworks, such <code>sails.js</code> for server and <code>angular</code> (version 1.*), backbone, knockout or other for client.
Have experience with using thirds party API or library for resolving specific issues.
I'm follower of TDD and prefer to use <code>mocha</code>, <code>chai</code> and <code>sinon</code> to be sure that I write code complies to wrote unit-test and my commits into VCS will not break builds in CI.
And of course I have some experience with all around:</p>
<ul>
<li>automated build tools: webpack, gulp, grunt;</li>
<li>layout with html or different template engines;</li>
<li>styling with scss, less and native css;</li>
</ul>
<h3>database</h3>
<p>I have experience with using various database directly or via different ORMs.
Both, <em>relation database</em>, like <code>PostgreSQL</code>, <code>MySQL</code> and <em>noSQL</em>, like <code>MongoDB</code>. Also, very early, DBMS like <code>FoxPro</code>, <code>Clarion</code>, etc.
I can read and write native SQL query, and optimizing heavy query. Also have some experience with writing stored procedures.</p>
<h3>php</h3>
<p>It's almost background experience, for now I have not plan to code on it again.
Early I work with numbers of services write on PHP, native and with frameworks.
Have experience with tiny framework like <code>Slim</code> or <code>Silex</code> and with more complex <code>Symfony</code>.</p>
<h3>other skills</h3>
<p>Have some experience with QA automation, I authoring automated tests using <code>Selenium</code> on javascript and java.
Some development'n'operations experience.</p>
