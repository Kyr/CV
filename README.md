# Not only coder
I consider myself an application developer, who, first of all, care about "getting-thing-done". And though delves into the application domain and understands what problem the created functionality should solve. The next, no less important part of my work, I consider the quality of the created code, the indicators of which are testability, supportability and understandability. And last but not least, I understand very well that a successful product is the result of the team's work.

## Proficiency

### javascript
Preferred way, for a past few years and for nearest feature.
For a last two year: front-end development with React and all around. 
Early: full stack javascript development, both, server's with `node.js` and browser's side develop.
Vanilla js and frameworks, such `sails.js` for server and `angular` (version 1.*), backbone, knockout or other for client.
Have experience with using thirds party API or library for resolving specific issues.
I'm follower of TDD and prefer to use `mocha`, `chai` and `sinon` to be sure that I write code complies to wrote unit-test and my commits into VCS will not break builds in CI.
And of course I have some experience with all around:
 - automated build tools: webpack, gulp, grunt;
 - layout with html or different template engines;
 - styling with scss, less and native css;

### database
I have experience with using various database directly or via different ORMs.
Both, *relation database*, like `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL` and *noSQL*, like `MongoDB`. Also, very early, DBMS like `FoxPro`, `Clarion`, etc.
I can read and write native SQL query, and optimizing heavy query. Also have some experience with writing stored procedures.

### php
It's almost background experience, for now I have not plan to code on it again.
Early I work with numbers of services write on PHP, native and with frameworks.
Have experience with tiny framework like `Slim` or `Silex` and with more complex `Symfony`.

### other skills
Have some experience with QA automation, I authoring automated tests using `Selenium` on javascript and java.
Some development'n'operations experience.
