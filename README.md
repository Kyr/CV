# Not only coder
I consider myself an application developer, whoum, first of all, care about "getting-thing-done". With this aim, I delves into the application domain to understands: what problem the created functionality should solve. The next, no less important part of my work, the quality of the created code, the indicators of which are testability, supportability and understandability. And last but not least, I understand very well that a successful product is the result of the team's work.

## Proficiency

### javascript
Preferred way, for a past few years and for nearest feature.
For a last two year: front-end development with React and all around. 
Early: full stack javascript development, both, server's with `node.js` and browser's side develop.
Vanilla js and frameworks, such `sails.js` for server and `angular` (version 1.*), backbone, knockout or other for client.
Have experience with using thirds party API or library for resolving specific issues.
I'm follower of TDD and prefer to use `mocha`, `chai` and `sinon` to be sure that I write code complies to wrote unit-test and my commits into VCS will not break builds in CI.
And of course I have some experience with all around:
 - automated build tools: webpack, gulp, grunt;
 - layout with html or different template engines;
 - styling with scss, less and native css;

### database
I have experience with using various database directly or via different ORMs.
Both, *relation database*, like `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL` and *noSQL*, like `MongoDB`. Also, very early, DBMS like `FoxPro`, `Clarion`, etc.
I can read and write native SQL query, and optimizing heavy query. Also have some experience with writing stored procedures.

### php
It's almost background experience, for now I have not plan to code on it again.
Early I work with numbers of services write on PHP, native and with frameworks.
Have experience with tiny framework like `Slim` or `Silex` and with more complex `Symfony`.

### other skills
Have some experience with QA automation, I authoring automated tests using `Selenium` on javascript and java.
Some development'n'operations experience.
